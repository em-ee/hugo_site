<h2>I have finally got around to doing some work on NHL data.</h2>
<p>A couple of days ago, Sean Tierney ( <span class="citation">[@ChartingHockey]</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ChartingHockey" class="uri">https://twitter.com/ChartingHockey</a>) ) posted this:</p>

<p>Sean does many great things with Tableau (see more <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/sean.tierney">here</a>) so of course I was super excited to see these new charts.</p>
<p>The data comes from <a href="http://moneypuck.com/about.htm">Moneypuck</a> and shows shots for NHL seasons 2007-2017. The dataset can be downloaded from Moneypuck - there’s over 1 million shots in the full dataset, however, so keep that in mind!</p>
<p>Looking at Sean’s charts, I chose a few players off the top of my head and one thing I noticed was a distinct difference in shot types between defensemen and forwards.</p>

<p>I have been meaning to do some analysis on hockey data for ages - but have never quite got properly around to it. But here I thought I might be able to do something relatively straightforward and see if I could cluster players based on their shot types.</p>
<p>I had a (very) quick search but couldn’t immediately see that anyone had done this with this dataset - but please do point me towards any similar analyses.</p>
<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level3">
<h3>Data wrangling:</h3>
<p>I started by filtering the data to just include the 2015-2017 seasons - even so there are still about 340,000 shots - plenty to start with.</p>

<p>The first time I tried to cluster shot types, I used totals of each shot type per player. However, this ended up clustering into players who had lots of shots and players who had very few shots - which is not very interesting or useful.</p>
<p>So I took the total of each shot type as a proportion of total shots taken by that player. (I thought about filtering out anyone who hadn’t had a certain number of shots - but decided against it at this stage as it looked like it would exclude too many players (e.g. the median total is 148 shots)).</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure how many clusters would be appropriate, so I ran k-means for 1:10 clusters and constructed an elbow plot - looking at this, the best number of clusters seemed to be 3 or 4. I chose 3 - when I tried it with 4, there were 2 clusters which seemed to have virtually no difference between them, although I’d like to explore this a bit further.</p>

<h3>Cluster 1:</h3>
<p>Cluster 1 has 60% defensemen, and 16% centers. The type of shots taken in this cluster is quite varied - 32% slapshots, 26% wrist shots, and 11% each of snap, tip and wraparounds.</p>

<h3>Conclusions and next steps:</h3>
<p>This was a pretty quick look at clustering players based on shot types. It doesn’t take into acount usage, different teams, different years, or anything more complicated.</p>
<p>However, It does support my initial observation from the charts that Sean created that there’s a distinct difference between the shots that forwards and defensemen take.</p>
<p>This could be a really interesting starting point to look at clusters over years:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have players moved cluster during their time in the NHL - or do clusters themselves change profile?</p></li>
<li><p>If a player has moved team, or changed coach, does this have any impact on their shooting profile and their comparable players?</p></li>
<li><p>What is going on in Cluster 3?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this fit in with other player evaluation metrics that exist?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m excited to look more in depth at this!</p>
<p>This was my first attempt at working with NHL data and if anyone has any constructive criticism or suggestions I’d be grateful to hear them!</p>
