<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I’ve been thinking for a long time about making a blog. I even went as far as creating an account on a couple of different blogging sites - and then just let them sit there and didn’t post anything. Then I decided to take part in #SoDS18 and one of my goals was to start a blog - so hopefully this time will be different!</p>
<p>I find it difficult/am reluctant to document my data science journey for two main reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>I am not super confident in my abilities yet, so am a bit worried about posting something which turns out to be completely wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>I can’t share anything I do at work as it’s confidential. So it’s a bit difficult to write about it with examples, and impossible to put anything on github, which means I need to start from scratch if I want to put any code out there.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That being said, in October I’m going to start a Data Science MSc, so provided I’m allowed, I’ll be able to post about my coursework. I am also trying to get somewhere with NHL analytics - so will post about that when I have something to say as well. I’m also going to try posting about things I’m doing at work generally, rather than specifically.</p>
<p>I’m aiming for at least one post a week - let’s see how it goes!</p>
